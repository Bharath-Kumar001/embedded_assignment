I don't have prior work experience in PCB design, so there may be some mistakes in the schematic or layout. Iâ€™ve done my best to learn and apply the concepts while working on this project. The whole assignment was completed over 2-3 days, including learning KiCad basics, making the symbol and footprint for nPM1100, wiring the schematic, and doing the PCB layout.
